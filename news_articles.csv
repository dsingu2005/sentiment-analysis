"In April 2019, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) hosted its first ever Autonomy Investor Day at its California headquarters. During the event, CEO Elon Musk promised the assembled analysts, journalists, investors and fans that Tesla is on the cusp of achieving full autonomy, known as Level 5 within the industry. He assured his audience that all Tesla vehicles equipped with full self-driving technology will be able to drive themselves without any human intervention whatsoever, allowing them to earn passive income for their owners as autonomous robotaxis.

Initially, markets reacted extremely to Musks prediction. Yet, as more time has passed, so too has skepticism of Teslas claims. Indeed, more than four years on from Autonomy Day, Tesla appears to have made precious little progress toward its goal.

The high cost of failure keeps getting higher

Failure to achieve full autonomy would be a huge problem for Tesla. Indeed, it could prove fatal to the company. Musk admitted as much during an interview in June of last year.

The overwhelming focus is on solving full self-driving,"" he said. ""Thats essential. Its really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.

The core problem facing Tesla is that it has been selling full self-driving to customers since 2018. What that means is the company has been selling a product that is incomplete, on the promise that it will be complete imminently, for the better part of five years. As of March, Tesla had sold the technology to approximately 400,000 customers. Should the company ultimately fail to deliver full self-driving in its long promised final form to these customers, it could face significant civil liability. I 

discussed

 this very point in February, highlighting the efforts of analysts who have attempted to quantify the scope of Teslas potential liability. Bill Maurer, for example, estimated that Tesla could be on the hook for something on the order of $4 billion in FSD-related refunds alone. That could be the tip of the proverbial iceberg; should the company be ordered to refund the full value of the vehicles in addition to the FSD package, Maurer estimated that the bill could run to as much as $240 billion.

Clearly, Tesla faces a serious problem if it cannot deliver on its FSD promises. As the timeline is pushed out even further, the risk grows ever greater that Teslas potential liability will become a real liability.

Musk sings the blues on latest earnings call

Tesla announced its financial results for the second quarter after the market closed on July 19. During the subsequent earnings call, Musk took some time to address the subject of full self-driving. Once again, he predicted that Tesla was mere months away from achieving full autonomy, though he acknowledged in the same breath that his similar past predictions proved erroneous:

I know Im the Boy Who Cried FSD, but I think it will be better than a human by the end of this year, he said.

Musk offered little in the way of tangible evidence to justify such confidence. The only real news he shared about its development was that Tesla will have to make major new investments in computing infrastructure in order to achieve full autonomy. That can hardly be called a resoundingly positive development, as the Wall Street Journals Stephen Wilmot observed on July 20:

Behind the grandiose claims, the only measure of Teslas AI progress was the dubious one of higher spending: Musk said Project Dojo alone would cost more than $1 billion over the next 12 months.

This was actually quite a remarkable admission on Musk's part. After all, he had long insisted that Tesla already had more than enough hardware and computing power to crack full self-driving. Clearly, that was not the case. Of course, this was hardly the first time Musk has been forced to walk back his claims. For example, he spent years deriding other autonomous vehicle developers for their use of radar, describing it as a crutch at best, only for Tesla to adopt radar as part of its full self-driving technology late last year.

My take

While the market continues to value Tesla at a hefty premium to its peers, cracks may be starting to show. The stock fell nearly 5% in after-hours trading following the earnings call, suggesting that investors were less than impressed with its latest update. As of the time of writing, Tesla was down another 10%.

The danger Tesla faces from potential full self-driving liability is difficult to overstate. The company has been selling a product for years that still does not exist, exposing itself to billions of dollars of refunds alone should it fail to deliver. It also threatens the massive pricing premium Tesla enjoys over other automakers, which is based in large part on its perceived leadership in autonomy. Should that perception waver, the company is liable to experience a painful downward revaluation, in my assessment.

For the time being, however, it remains to be seen whether Teslas post-earnings slump has truly snapped the rally that has carried the stock since the start of 2023.

"Tesla shares retreated nearly 20% Thursday as investors digested earnings results that showed record revenue and strong profits, but also falling gross margins. Gross margins were 18.2%, down from 25% over the same period last year and 19.3% over the first quarter.

"Tesla Inc.

 CEO Elon Musk appears to be involved in a secretive project constructing an all-glass home near the company's Austin-area Gigafactory, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. Dubbed Project 42 by Tesla employees, this initiative has been shrouded in mystery over the past year.

The Wall Street Journal sources claim that Tesla's board launched an investigation into concerns that Musk might be using company funds to build his glass house. The project is said to involve the purchase of millions of dollars worth of special glass, which raised eyebrows among employees. Limited liability firms associated with Musk and Tesla executives have also acquired substantial amounts of land in the vicinity.

Though various design concepts are reportedly under consideration, the transparent structure will be situated just outside of Austin, Texas, with a view of Tesla's headquarters in the distance. One proposed plan envisions a hexagonal shape with waterfront views, while another resembles the boxy design of Apple's store on Fifth Avenue in New York.

Following the substantial glass order, employees' concerns were raised, prompting an internal probe to determine whether any misuse of company resources had taken place. As of now, the status and findings of the inquiry remain undisclosed.

The company had disbanded its public relations (PR) department, and Musk has refrained from commenting on the reports. The board's primary objective was to establish Musk's level of involvement in the project and ascertain whether company resources, including employee time, were being used for the construction of the glass house.

Stringent Board Requirements

For followers of the billionaire entrepreneur, news of the glass house might come as a surprise, given Musk's previous statements about not having a desire to own a home. High-profile tech executives occasionally receive perks, such as private jets, but Tesla's approach is notably stringent, requiring a board committee audit for expenses exceeding $120,000 involving people with material interests.

Musk's prominence as a major CEO adds significance to this case, especially considering his history of legal entanglements. He is still embroiled in a dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding his tweets about financial data and previously faced a defamation lawsuit from a British cave explorer.

In May 2020, Musk set the internet abuzz with one of his tweets. He declared his intention to sell nearly all physical possessions, asserting, ""Will own no house.""

During an interview with TED head Chris Anderson in 2022, Musk delved further into his unconventional living situation, shedding light on his perspective regarding the criticisms aimed at billionaires and their opulent lifestyles. When confronted with the notion that some critics find such extravagance offensive, Musk acknowledged the potential problem it could pose, saying, ""For sure, it would be very problematic if I was consuming billions of dollars a year in personal consumption.""

Musk’s Circumstances

He was quick to clarify that his own circumstances were far from extravagant. He disclosed that he didn't own a home, opting to stay with friends instead. Musk's schedule often took him to the Bay Area, where much of Tesla's engineering was concentrated, and in such instances, he would rotate through the spare bedrooms of his friends' houses for lodging.

Musk's frugality extended beyond housing. He shared that he did not indulge in luxuries such as yachts or extravagant vacations. But one notable exception to this minimalistic approach is his reliance on a private plane. He admitted that having access to a plane served a practical purpose, providing him with valuable hours for work, which aligned with his unrelenting commitment to his ventures.

Given the prominent entrepreneurs position as the CEO or Founder of companies like Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink and many others, this is justified as a necessity rather than a luxury. The growth of these startups is what skyrocketed his wealth status of ‘world’s richest man.’ The lucrative nature of startups has even prompted a recent surge in startup investing among retail investors. Hundreds of millions are being invested a year in startups like

As Project 42 continues to pique public interest, these insights into Musk's way of life add yet another layer of intrigue to the enigmatic glass house being built exclusively for the visionary entrepreneur. It remains to be seen how this project fits into his overall philosophy and whether it will ultimately become the elusive home he once declared he would never own.
